/* Objective: A salesman must travel to 50 different state capitals.
   Given a random route through the US,the salesman must travel to
   each capital from index 0 to the last index on his route and then
   from the last index to the first (round trip). Use a genetic method:
   (find the best specimen, spawn new ones based on that
   speciment with a single random change to each, and repeat the
   process for many generations, selecting the best one each time)
   Use the method to find the optimal route over many generations. */

/**
 * Main method/ Takes an initial group of genes(cities), creates a condition on which to judge them
 * with initiateBloodline(createRoute), finds the strongest by using assessFitness (calculateDistance),
 * create a new generation based on the strongest by making copies and mutate them (alterRoute).
 * Repeat this process as many times as specified (availableResources) and return the best of the last generation.

 * @param  {[Function]} initiateBloodline  [Create a new collection of routes based on the best one from last generation]
